			<p>I am Padmaja Kondeti. I used to work as a Visual Basic developer. I took a long break to take care of my three daughters. I used to volunteer at my daughtersâ€™ schools and maintain their PTA websites. I often used to face challenges in updating or creating new pages for their website. I used to wonder if I can join some course to overcome these challenges. Then I found some web development and design courses at Middle Sex County College. I learnt HTML,CSS, PHP, MYSQL, Photoshop, Flash etc. I then became a freelance web developer and developed websites for local businesses like Valentino Constructions, Manasa Sangeet Music School, and Brunswick Cardiology. Then I got an opportunity to work as a consultant at Verizon Wireless. At Verizon Wireless, I mostly worked on Adobe Target along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery etc. I worked there for two and a half years, the maximum allowed for a consultant. After Verizon Wireless I got an opportunity to work on a short term project at InventiveHealth. I got a break from my work recently and I wanted to improve my skillset.</p>

			<p>I joined Rutgers Coding Boot Camp. The curriculum is very well organized and self-motivating. I learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript, github, heroku, Bootstrap, jQuery, APIs, Firebase, nodejs, express, handlebars, MVC concepts, ORM, sequelize, MongoDB, React and Sass etc. The course is very intense and high demanding. It gave me exposure to new technologies. The homework and classwork are quite challenging. With this learning experience, I am better ready to take on my next job.</p>
